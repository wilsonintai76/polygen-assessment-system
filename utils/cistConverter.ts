  //   // But in Course type, topics is string[] usually.
  //   // Wait, in api.ts GET, topics is mapped to string[].
  //   // But we need the ID.
  //   // The Course object in memory might not have topic IDs if it came from the UI state which only has strings.
  //   // However, if we loaded it from API, we might have the original data?
  //   // Actually, the Course interface has `topics?: string[]`.
  //   // This is a problem. We need topic IDs to save to the DB.
  //   // If the UI only works with codes, we can't save relations without looking up IDs.
  //   // We might need to fetch topics again or store them better in the Course object.
  //   return ''; 
  // };
  
  // Actually, let's look at how we can get topic IDs.
  // The Course object from API has `topics` as string array "Code Name".
  // But we need the ID from the `topics` table.
  // If the user is editing a course, they might have added new topics which don't have IDs yet.
  // Or they are using existing topics.
  
  // Strategy: The backend RPC `save_course_data` likely handles topic creation/lookup by code.
  // If we are constructing `CistBlueprint` objects to send to the backend, we might need to send codes if IDs are missing?
  // But `CistRow` expects `topic_id` (UUID).
  
  // If we are strictly following the schema provided, we need UUIDs.
  // If the frontend doesn't have UUIDs, we can't construct valid `CistRow` objects.
  
  // However, maybe we can send a "DTO" structure that the backend understands?
  // The `save_course_data` RPC likely takes the whole JSON and does the work.
  // So maybe we don't need to generate perfect `CistBlueprint` objects with UUIDs.
  // We can generate objects with codes, and let the backend resolve them.
  
  // But the prompt implies I should use the tables.
  // If I can't change the backend, I must rely on what `save_course_data` does.
  // If `save_course_data` expects the `jsuTemplate` (MatrixRow[]) and does the logic, then I don't need to do anything!
  
  // BUT, the user provided the SQL. This usually means "I want you to use these tables".
  // If the RPC doesn't use them, I'm stuck.
  // If the RPC *does* use them, then `save_course_data` must be updated to use them.
  // Since I can't update the RPC, I have to assume it's already updated or I need to bypass it.
  
  // Let's assume the RPC is NOT updated and I need to do it manually?
  // No, that's too risky without transaction support.
  
  // Let's assume the RPC *is* updated to accept `blueprints` array in the JSON and populate the tables.
  // So my job is to convert `jsuTemplate` (MatrixRow[]) -> `blueprints` (CistBlueprint[]-like structure).
  // Even if I don't have IDs, I can put codes in a temporary field if the backend supports it.
  // Or, I can try to find IDs if available.
